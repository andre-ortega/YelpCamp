# YelpCamp

## Background

The Colt Steele Web Development Bootcamp is a well-known program for teaching the fundamentals of web programming. This includes not only the HTML/CSS/Javascript base, but further technologies needed to create fully functioning web appications. The terminal, dynamic templating, routers, cookies, RestFul APIs, MongoDB, and many more technologies are present in the instructions of this course, and all of them are used to create the YelpCamp application. This was a truly fantastic course that was worth more than what I paid for, and provided a scope of knowledge that was lacking from my university-level courses.

## Intro

After many hours of lessons providing the logic on which the web operates, they all come together in creating YelpCamp. During my development of this application, I chose to add a degree of difficulty by deviating from the provided instructions given for a Windows or Mac development environment and instead decided to create the app using Linux. WSL2 for Windows now (to my amazement) provides all of the functionality needed to run native Linux programs that I enjoy using. Therefore, aside from the Javascript and web framework languages used to create YelpCamp, I was assisted by some of my Python and Bash scripts used to speed up the processes of file organization, terminal operations, and Git workflows.
